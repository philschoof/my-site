                <li>
                    I don’t just advise—I execute. Strategy is important, but execution is where things succeed or fail. I make sure projects don’t just get planned—they get finished.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I know both sides—creative & technical. I’ve worked across both art and technology, giving me a rare ability to translate creative vision into structured execution.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I keep execution simple, structured, and scalable. Whether you’re launching something new or trying to fix a stalled project, I help you focus on what actually moves the needle.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>
